                      <p>My name is Stephanie Hoffman, and I am on my way to becoming a software developer. I am a graduate of the University of Washington, where I earned my degree in Business Administration, 
                            with a concentration in International Business and Marketing. My career dream was to attend law school and become an attorney, specialize in Estate Planning. A few years ago, after a few attempts 
                            to gain acceptance into a school, and after much deliberation, I decided to no longer pursue law. About a year after my decision, I began to find 
                            new inspiration drawing me towards the world of tech.</p>
                      <p>I was intrigued by my roommate’s transition to a software engineer through a coding bootcamp, and the fun projects they worked on -- I 
                            began to vicariously learn the fundamentals and processes that went into developing software. It seemed like they were creating something out of nothing -- it was magic! I channeled my curiosity to 
                            code through online beginner courses like Harvard’s CS50 and Udemy, and studied courses such as HTML 5 + CSS 3, C, and Ruby. While it has been a challenge learning these new languages, I have had so 
                            much fun creating programs and watching them come to life.</p>
